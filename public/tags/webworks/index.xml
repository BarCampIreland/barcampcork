      <description>This post should have been written last weekend so apologies for the slowness.
There are a bunch of people to thank for the success of BarCamp. It genuinely couldn&amp;rsquo;t have happened without them.
 YOU! BarCamp is about everyone contributing in some way. The speakers did an awesome job and everyone else asked, discussed, argued and queried brilliantly. Thank you all (110+ of you) for coming and making it the best BarCamp yet.</description>
