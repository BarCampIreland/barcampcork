      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a page later today with all of the session topics suggested so far by people. However there is one aspect which we need to make clear. BarCamp is a non-commercial unconference and, as such, straight company or product pitches are not appropriate.
We don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound negative about this but it&amp;rsquo;s important. We all love our own companies and our own apps but speaking for 20 minutes about you isn&amp;rsquo;t really that interesting or educational.</description>
