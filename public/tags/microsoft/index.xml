      <description>An event like Barcamp Cork or any other event for that matter could not run without sponsors. This year we have some fantastic sponsors that have been absolutely amazing to us, helping us organise a free conference for you! Reciprocate the kindness and check them out!

      <description>Thanks to the Sponsors of Barcamp Cork 2009, Microsoft, Assembly Point, Reilly &amp;amp; Co and Nitrosell, we have some freebies what we&amp;rsquo;d like to give away.
We&amp;rsquo;d like to run a fun competition which a few people can win, we&amp;rsquo;ll be giving away some great free techie stuff. We&amp;rsquo;d like if the competition promoted the sponsors too since they helped make Barcamp happen.
Any fun ideas for a competition?</description>
