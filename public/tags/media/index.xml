      <description>Cork based TV and Video production company StormVids will be scooting and shooting throughout the day. Look out for their vids a few days later, all set to embed in your blogs and put on Facebook. I had a great chat with them last week and it&amp;rsquo;ll be fantastic to see some high-quality footage of BarCamp.
At the more grainy end of things, I&amp;rsquo;m sure the usual suspects (like me) will also be QIkking, Ustreaming and Flixwagoning on their phones.</description>
