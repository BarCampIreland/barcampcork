      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great *Camps in Ireland since the first BarCamp Cork back in 2006. We&amp;rsquo;ve learned lots, become friends with many people we&amp;rsquo;ve met there and hopefully shared what knowledge we have.
However one discussion topic that has bubbled up regularly in between the Irish BarCamps has been the very structured format of them. Many feel that we&amp;rsquo;ve perhaps not fully embraced the &amp;ldquo;Un&amp;rdquo; aspect of Unconference. The fear of the unknown and fear of failure would have been my reason for trying to make sure everything was &amp;ldquo;organised&amp;rdquo; in advance of the first BarCamp.</description>
