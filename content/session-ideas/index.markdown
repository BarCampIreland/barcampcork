In keeping with our idea of avoiding too much pre-structuring of the day, we are not going to ask people to formally announce session titles etc. However we do want to get some idea of the areas people want to [a] hear about and [b] talk about. If the day works well, those two things will merge. Rest assured that if you want to talk on something, you will get the opportunity.

We have one or two things which will require some setup in advance and we'll highlight those because they will need your help.

In the meantime, just use the comments section below to suggest ideas and mention topics you want to take part in. I'll kick it off.
