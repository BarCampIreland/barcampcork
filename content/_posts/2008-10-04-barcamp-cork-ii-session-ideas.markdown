In keeping with our approach of avoiding too much pre-structuring of the day, we are not going to ask people to formally announce session titles etc. However we do want to get some idea of the areas people want to [a] hear about and [b] talk about. If the day works well, those two things will merge. Rest assured that if you want to talk on something, you will get the opportunity.

We have one or two things which will require some setup in advance and we’ll highlight those because they will need your help.

In the meantime, just use the [comments section here](http://www.barcampcork.com/session-ideas/) to suggest ideas and mention topics you want to take part in. I’ve kicked it off.

NOTE: Please e-mail us if you have any specific needs for a session. We should have projectors (still looking for offers of those and audio equipment!) and there is free Wifi in the building. But for anything else, let us know.
