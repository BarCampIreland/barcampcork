Irish IT Conference turns the audience into the presenters.

The first BarCamp event to be held in Ireland will bring a fresh twist to the usual IT gatherings. BarCamp is an event model imported from the United States with the mantra of No spectators, only participants.

Conor O'Neill, of Argolon Solutions, one of the event organisers stated BarCamp is an informal gathering of people from technical and business backgrounds who wish to share their knowledge and learn from others. BarCamp has a policy of encouraging active participation in all discussions.

Discussions on the day will include: Working in niche markets, VC and angel funding, war stories from starting software companies in Ireland and How to run a real business inside a virtual world. However the
flexible BarCamp structure allows anyone to start their own discussion by adding their topic to the discussion noticeboard on the day.

Co-organiser Walter Higgins Of Sxoop.com added Building our knowledge economy starts with creating a community of developers and business people to manage this, events like BarCamp are hoped to start this process.

BarCamp Ireland is an all-day event being held in the Webworks* building in Cork on Saturday September 30th. To attend, please follow the instructions at the BarCampIreland Wiki. You can also subscribe to the BarCampIreland Blog for news updates.

*The Webworks building is a custom built property for IT companies and companies that utilise a large amount of information technology.
