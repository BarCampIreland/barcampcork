For those of you who are around on Friday evening, the un-plan is as follows:

I’ll be in Webworks all day at an EI course and we’ll be getting things like chairs, drinks and AV delivered throughout the day.

That course finishes at 5.30 4ish and we switch into BarCamp mode then. We will be doing setup for however long it takes so please pop on over to lend a hand if you are free.

Once we are done it is over to Wagamama for some nosh. I’ve no idea how long setup will take but the more hands we have the quicker it will be.

If anyone needs directions to Wagamama just let us know.

Call 087-9790297 and ask for Conor the blow-in who still doesn’t know where Apple is, if you get lost!
