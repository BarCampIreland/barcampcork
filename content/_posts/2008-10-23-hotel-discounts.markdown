The cool guys at [Roomex.com](http://www.roomex.com/) have just become our latest sponsors by giving us a bunch of discounts for Cork hotels in their system. Keep a close eye over the next 24hrs as they mentioned there will be more discounts by tomorrow.

I see 15 Cork hotels listed on our special [BarCamp page](http://barcamp.roomexhotels.com) with a wide variety of prices. The eagle-eyed amongst you will notice that actually all of their 20,000 hotels have an extra BarCamp discount on them so you have a week to book all of your upcoming travel!
