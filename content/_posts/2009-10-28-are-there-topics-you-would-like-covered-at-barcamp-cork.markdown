Over 50 people are [attending  BarCampCork](http://www.barcampcork.com/attendees/) in November so far, are you going? If you can, [please register your interest](http://www.barcampcork.com/register/) so we have an idea of numbers and know how much coffee to pour on the day.

19 people have [registered to give talks](http://www.barcampcork.com/sessionstalks) on the day too so far, Thank you all for giving these talks. If you know anyone that would give an interesting techie talk, can you give them a little nudge to talk?

If you have any topics you’d like to see covered on the day, [please let us know](http://www.barcampcork.com/session-ideas/).
