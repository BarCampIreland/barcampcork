What excitement, just over a week to Barcamp Cork!

The day will kick off at 10:00am with registration and Coffee from 10:00 to 10:15. The day will end at 5pm with 'afters' to be arranged :)

The talks will be running in 4 separate rooms throughout the day, the Blacknight Room, the Microsoft Room, the JustMobile Room and the Maxroam Room. Each speaker is given 30 minutes (questions included in that time) and 15 minutes for a changeover in between. The last two sessions of the day are 30 minutes.
