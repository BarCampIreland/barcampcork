If you wish to **really** be a massive help to Barcamp Cork, find myself, James Whelton, on the morning to find out how you can give a hand or email me: _me(@)jameswhelton(.)com_

We are looking for people to be ready to pounce on matters such as presentation difficulties, etc, and just to float around willing to give a hand. I'm sure there will be enough of you fellow geeks there willing to give a hand with the technical stuff :)
