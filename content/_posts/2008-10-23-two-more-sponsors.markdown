A big thank you to Pat Phelan of [Cubic Telecom](http://www.maxroam.com/) for sponsoring the lunch at BarCamp. The ice-swans and champagne fountains have been ordered. But seriously, Pat has been a fantastic supporter of of the tech community and many of us are in his debt.

Thanks also to John Henry Donovan of [5pieces](http://www.5pieces.com/) who took care of the licensing of our sign-up form. This was totally unexpected and very much appreciated.
