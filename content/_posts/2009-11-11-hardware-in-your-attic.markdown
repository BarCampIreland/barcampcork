A few people attending BarCamp this week will be dusting off some no-so-modern pieces of hardware from their attics and bringing them along to show them off.

Check out [Randy's collection of toys](http://www.branedy.net/?page_id=305) on his blog, since he can't carry them all on the day, let him know if you'd like to see any of them specifically.

Have you any computer hardware in the attic or garage that you could bring along?
