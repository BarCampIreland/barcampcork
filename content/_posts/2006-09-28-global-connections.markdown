The guys organising BarCampMilwaukee want to do what they are calling a “Global Connections” session. They realised that their event, BarCampVienna, BarCampBerlin, BarCampIreland and others are all on over the same two day period and thought it might be interesting to hook up by various means at one point on Saturday.

Unfortunately they are running this at 7pm our time at which point we will all be gone. However, I thought it was worth mentioning in case any of our attendees wanted to hook up with these guys on their own to share experiences after our event. In any case, you’ll find all the information over at:
