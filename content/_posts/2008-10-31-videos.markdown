Cork based TV and Video production company [StormVids](http://www.stormvids.ie/) will be scooting and shooting throughout the day.
Look out for their vids a few days later, all set to embed in your blogs and put on Facebook. I had a great chat with them last week and it'll be fantastic to see some high-quality footage of BarCamp.

At the more grainy end of things, I'm sure the usual suspects (like me) will also be QIkking, Ustreaming and Flixwagoning on their phones. If you record anything or take any pics, let us know about them so we can link over afterwards.
