After the feedback we've received on the "[Build a Webapp in a Day](http://www.barcampcork.com/2008/10/23/build-a-web-app-in-a-day-at-barcamp/)" proposal along with some discussions last Friday, we've decided to re-position things slightly.

The idea now is that the webapp will be the tangible output from a very extended training session in the Django web framework given by [Bartosz Ptaszynski](http://yazzgoth.org/). The plan therefore is now as follows:



*  Bart will kick off an introduction to Django as the first tutorial of the day at 10am
* Anyone who is interested and is generally competent in programming is very welcome to take part in the build
* At least one designer is needed to make this look great
* At 10.40 the spec for the app will be walked through and the screens discussed and agreed
* Bart will provide the object model
* Designer(s) then start the design process on the screens and the developers start on their tasks
* Each developer is given responsibility for a specific screen or piece of functionality
* Bart will then mentor, guide and help everyone through the process
* NO-ONE is expected to work all day. Ideally people will work in bursts, attend sessions/talks that interest them and then complete whatever it is they are responsible for as the day progresses
* Bart will manage the overall code integration with the help of others and co-ordinate the design integration
* **Deployment may be on an Amazon EC2 instance but this is subject to change. At the moment we need someone to _own_ the development server and deployment server "problem" i.e. deciding what, where, how, setting it up and having it ready for 10am Saturday.**
* All going well, there will be a operational application deployed to its own domain by 5pm



All feedback welcome.







By taking this approach we hope that the proposal for a Webapp or Web Business brainstorming session [as suggested by Ant Galvin](http://www.barcampcork.com/2008/10/23/build-a-web-app-in-a-day-at-barcamp/#comment-116) will also go ahead.
