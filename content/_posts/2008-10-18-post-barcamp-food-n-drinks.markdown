Rather than have everyone scatter to the four winds after BarCamp we've decided to have a sit-down meal followed by some drinks. I've heard many good things about the Eastern Tandoori over the years so I'd like to suggest that. Please let us know in the comments if you'd like to attend. Once we know numbers we should be able to get a good-value fixed price menu.

As for drinks, suggestions? Microbrewery worked very well the last time. What is it called? Alternatives?
