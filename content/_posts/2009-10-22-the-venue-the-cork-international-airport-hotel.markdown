We have 3 large rooms booked for the day for concurrent talks with the option of splitting one of the rooms into two medium sized rooms.

There is a tiny little room too, off one of main rooms which might be good for smaller talks or demos.
When the talks have wrapped up for the afternoon we can all wander across the hall to the bar for a couple of drinks and watch the match.
