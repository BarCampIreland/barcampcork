Sam Sethi over at [TechCrunch UK](https://web.archive.org/web/20070909070708/http://uk.techcrunch.com/) has written about [Saturday’s event](https://web.archive.org/web/20070314092244/http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/10/01/barcamp-ireland-is-a-success/). For those of you who don’t work in the web area, TechCrunch is the most highly trafficked and highly regarded web 2.0 news site. Sam recently launched the UK arm of it and has been very generous in his coverage of Ireland. Thanks for the mention Sam, I can’t wait to see where the next event will be held over here.
