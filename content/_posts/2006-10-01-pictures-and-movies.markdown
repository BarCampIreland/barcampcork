We already have a bunch of pictures of the day over [at Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barcampireland/). If you are uploading, please use barcamp and barcampireland as your tags. If you have pictures and don’t have a Flickr account, send them to us at barcampireland at gmail dot come and we’ll do it for you.

If you go to the [Backnetwork](http://barcampireland1.backnetwork.com/), you can see all the pictures and blog posts of the day by those who signed up to the backnetwork. If you haven’t already signed up, please do by sending your email address to the address above. It gives us one central location for all the buzz on the event.

Also, please feel free to use [the review writing tool](http://barcampireland1.backnetwork.com/reviews/) on the backnetwork to review the day or individual sessions. You can easily copy the review to your blog too.

Videos on [Blip.tv](http://blip.tv/posts/?search=barcampireland) already and on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=barcampireland&search=Search) coming later today!
