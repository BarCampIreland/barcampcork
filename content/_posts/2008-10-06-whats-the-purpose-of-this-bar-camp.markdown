I really hope I make it on the 1st but even if I don't I wanted to make a point that the informal dialogue we are supposed to have as people interested in Web 2.0 is one we should extend to brands and organisations.

I don't mean we should set up Bar Camp to sell services to them but I mean it's be really valuable to engage with the corporate sector and the public sector so we can learn more about where they perceive their problems to be.

I've sent a message or two out to companies I know - not IT companies of course. Would anyone else see a value in a Dialogue With The Brands strand? Maybe EI can help with this?
