We're aiming for BarCamp-lite this time around. A minimum of fuss and bother around irrelevant contextual stuff and a maximum focus on making a kick-ass day that will be remembered. Having said that, we do need help with a bunch of things. If you can help with these in any way, please contact us at barcampcork AT gmail DOT com:



* Contributors - See the Manifesto post. A sign-up form will go up this week so you can register your interest in attending and giving some indication of how you would like to contribute on the day.
* General Sponsorship - The bulk of this is for refreshments and lunch but also things like flipcharts and equipment hire if we don't manage to beg/borrow/steal it. All sponsors will be gratefully acknowledged here and on the day.
* Specific Sponsors. So far we have:

	    * EI/Howard Holdings providing the venue/wifi
	    * Blacknight hosting the blog
	    * We will also have some equipment/tool sponsors for the practical sessions
	    * Possibly other web-related sponsors for the webapp development
	    * Hotel/B&B sponsors providing discount rates to attendees would be appreciated


* Name badges - what do you all think? Overkill? Handwritten ones on the day sufficient?
* Projectors - Preferably 3+
* Audio - Mics and loudspeakers. This is very necessary if we decide to use the open coffee area again. Cordless mics would be even better so they can be handed around.
* A logo - Anyone up for doing the BarCamp Cork II logo based on the standard approach?
* Developers/Designers - We'll do a post on the "build a webapp in a day" idea very soon. If you want to take part in this, we definitely want you involved well ahead of time
* What really obvious things are we forgetting?
* Coverage - We only have four weeks so we need to get the message out locally, nationally and Europe-wide too. Hopefully we'll get some people over from the UK like we did the first time around. Blog it, tweet it, email it, write about it in the newspaper. Do it.
