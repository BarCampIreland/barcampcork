Bernie and his gang at IT Tipperary are looking to do interviews with some of the BarCamp speakers. I guess they will be released as podcasts. If you are up for it, send your telephone numbers, Skype details or SIP details to barcampireland at gmail dot com and theyâ€™ll make ya famous. Alternatively post them here as comments if you are really brave.

Also, keep adding or sending your PPTs, we only have a tiny collection so far.
