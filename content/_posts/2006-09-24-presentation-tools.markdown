I guess most people presenting will either

* Just talk
* Have Powerpoint Slides
* Have OpenOffice Impress slides
* Do live demos
* Give Wink screencasts
* Mime

Anyone intending to use Eric Meyer’s S5 as demonstrated to great effect by some of the microformats guys?

S5 is a Simple Standards based Slide Show System which uses XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If I manage to do a talk I’ll be basing a major part of it on existing S5-based presentations so I guess I’ll end up using it by default.

Any other physical tools that people need? Elly mentioned audio. Anyone need flipcharts or even an OHP with markers (old school baby, yeah).

Let us know by comments or email to barcampireland at gmail dot com.
