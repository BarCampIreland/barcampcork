Bart has made the code-drop from Saturday available. He'll do another drop later this week with a better landing page etc.

 
It requires:



* Python 2.5
* Django 1.0
* sqlite3
* pysqlite3

Right now you can either access the [http://localhost:8000/events/](http://localhost:8000/events/) or the [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) pages to play around.
login: admin
pass: barcamp
