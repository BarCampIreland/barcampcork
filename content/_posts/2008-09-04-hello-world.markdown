We have a date: November 1st 2008

We have a venue: Webworks, Eglinton Street, Cork

We have a blog.

We have 4 weeks.

For the next few days, we'll post some thoughts on some of the things we'd like to achieve with this BarCamp. The focus is on trying new ideas and trying to put the **Un** back in **Un**conference.

The venue/wireless is being kindly provided by EI/IDA/Howard Holdings. The blog is kindly hosted by Blacknight Solutions.
