The backnetwork is filling up nicely with people (don’t forget to make links to those you know) and we are just ready for the day.

If we don’t have your email address then we can’t send an invite.

But we will have a page up on the day with sign-up codes so you can grab one and sign-up via Wifi on the spot or do so after you get home.

Between the blog post aggreagtion, flickr aggregation and live chat on the day, it is going to be a great resource.
