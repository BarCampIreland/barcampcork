We're genuinely blown away that [Donncha](http://ocaoimh.ie/), [Toni](http://toni.org/), [Matt](http://ma.tt/) and the guys n gals in [Automattic](http://www.automattic.com/) are sponsoring BarCamp Cork II. You'll probably know them better as the people behind [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/), [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/), [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/) and [Akismet](http://akismet.com/).

This blog and thousands of other Irish ones, run on the software created by these guys and are protected from spam by them too. It all runs like a charm on a [Blacknight](http://www.blacknight.ie/) shared hosting account.

Donncha will also be giving a talk which, if it's anything like the one in Waterford, will be a must-attend.

We've setup a PayPal facility to make sponsorship as easy as possible. In the interests of disclosure, you should know that the sponsorship money will be held in an Argolon Solutions/LouderVoice bank account.
