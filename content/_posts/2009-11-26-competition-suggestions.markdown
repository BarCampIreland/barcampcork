Thanks to the Sponsors of Barcamp Cork 2009, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/ireland), [Assembly Point](http://www.assemblypoint.com/), [Reilly & Co](http://dreilly.ie) and [Nitrosell](http://www.nitrosell.com/), we have some freebies what we'd like to give away.

We'd like to run a fun competition which a few people can win, we'll be giving away some great free techie stuff. We'd like if the competition promoted the sponsors too since they helped make Barcamp happen.

**Any fun ideas for a competition?**
