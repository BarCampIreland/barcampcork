We have at least one person coming on November 1st who will have a child in tow. We want to facilitate this in a way that works best for everyone. Would love to get some ideas here. Obviously babies are no problem at all and older ones can take care of themselves but how best to deal with other ages? I'm happy to bring game consoles etc and put them somewhere they can hang out. Thoughts?
