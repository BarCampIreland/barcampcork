      <p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of great *Camps in Ireland since the first BarCamp Cork back in 2006. We&rsquo;ve learned lots, become friends with many people we&rsquo;ve met there and hopefully shared what knowledge we have.</p>
<p>However one discussion topic that has bubbled up regularly in between the Irish BarCamps has been the very structured format of them. Many feel that we&rsquo;ve perhaps not fully embraced the &ldquo;Un&rdquo; aspect of Unconference. The fear of the unknown and fear of failure would have been my reason for trying to make sure everything was &ldquo;organised&rdquo; in advance of the first BarCamp.Â We&rsquo;d like to redouble our efforts to avoid this with BarCamp Cork II and really push to make it as surprising, impromptu and two-way as we possibly can.</p>
<p>To this end, there are two phrases we want to concentrate on in Webworks: &ldquo;<em>talking with, not talking at</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>doing more, talking less</em>&rdquo;. There are a bunch of ways of achieving this and some of them are as follows (please give your own suggestions in the comments):</p>
<ul>
<li>Insisting that slideware sessions to be kept to a minimum and limited to 20 mins</li>
<li>Running an <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2008/09/where-the-hell-is-matt-presentation-ignite-style.html">Ignite session</a> for pure slideware (5 minutes, 20 slides)</li>
<li>Focussing relentlessly on facilitiating discussions with active participants rather that talking at passive listeners. No more talk + Q&amp;A. It should be all Q&amp;A with &ldquo;presenters&rdquo; as moderators.</li>
<li>Asking questions, not making statements</li>
<li>Running a &ldquo;build a webapp in a day&rdquo; session for the entire day (details to follow)</li>
<li>Offering your problems/challenges to your audience to solve (&ldquo;How do I&hellip;?&quot;)</li>
<li>Setting up hands-on technical tutorial sessions (e.g. how to use Sketchup to model buildings and cities, under the hood of Wordpress etc)</li>
<li>Insisting on absolutely no branding or commercial pitching during sessions</li>
<li>Highlighting technology as a tool to achieve useful ends, not as an end in itself</li>
<li>Looking at ways of using technology to enable creativity</li>
<li>Pulling in as many non-tech people as possible - media, art, education, finance, energy, entertainment, charity</li>
</ul>
