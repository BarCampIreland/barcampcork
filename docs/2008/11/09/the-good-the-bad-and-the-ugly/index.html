      <p>Every BarCamp is different and I hope we can learn each time from what went well and what didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to kick off with a few of my thoughts about last weekend but I&rsquo;m much more interested in hearing all of your thoughts.</p>
<p>So in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The venue - still amazing and just ideal for an event like this</li>
<li>Rooms - two is not enough. Even the addition of the small third room was insufficient. Three decent sized spaces with a few break-out areas appears to be ideal</li>
<li>The 20 minute experiment was interesting. It was perfect in some cases but it looks like 30 minutes is the sweet spot for most talks.</li>
<li>I have no opinion on the 40 minutes for tutorials as I missed them all. Thoughts?</li>
<li>BarCamps need self-appointed timekeepers. The overruns were not disasterous but still annoying for some. People were far too polite about stopping the overruns.</li>
<li>The no-schedule approach of BarCamp worked well. It&rsquo;s something that seems to scare a lot of people but I&rsquo;m 100% in favour of it. An empty grid where anyone could grab any slot. We just needed to make the system more clear in advance. I still had people asking if there &ldquo;was a slot available&rdquo; right up to the morning of the event. Earlybirds always do well at BarCamp!</li>
<li>The session streams were setup badly (by me). Instead of long talks outside and short talks inside, it should have been non-tech talks outside and tech talks inside. We had several instances where both rooms had tech talks on at the same time which was less than ideal for many attendees</li>
<li>The mix of talks was fantastic. Still quite tech-heavy but lots of other too. The biz ones seemed to be particularly popular. Time for a BizCamp?</li>
<li>The mix of people was a real pleasure to see. From secondary school students to grandparents, I think we had it all.</li>
<li>A constant supply of tea/coffee/water is necessary. Why can&rsquo;t pay-for conferences get this right? We were very lucky that Webworks could facilitate this. Thanks again to Kay.</li>
<li>How did people feel about the mics? The reason we got them was that at BarCamp Cork 1, we couldn&rsquo;t hear speakers in the open area properly due to the amount of chatter. Were all the sessions ok from an audio perspective?</li>
<li>To make BarCamp more accessible for more people, a talk like Emma Persky&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Geek&rsquo;s Guide to BarCamping&rdquo; should be the opening one at every BarCamp. It just tells newbies what it is all about and sets the tone for the day. </li>
<li>Pre and Post events make it an even more social occasion</li>
<li>The webapp was a very worthwhile experiment and there&rsquo;ll be a separate follow-up post about how that went</li>
<li>There were no complaints about wifi. A conference first?</li>
<li>The lack of a large amount of video and pics from the day is a reflection of how busy everyone was doing face2face social networking. </li>
</ul>
<p>But more importantly, what did YOU think?</p>
