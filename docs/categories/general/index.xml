      <description>Sam Sethi over at TechCrunch UK has written about Saturday’s event. For those of you who don’t work in the web area, TechCrunch is the most highly trafficked and highly regarded web 2.0 news site. Sam recently launched the UK arm of it and has been very generous in his coverage of Ireland. Thanks for the mention Sam, I can’t wait to see where the next event will be held over here.</description>

      <description>I may be one of the organisers but can I just say:
BarCamp Ireland ROCKED!
It was the best event I’ve attended in a very long time and that was entirely due to the enthusiasm of all the attendees and in particular, those who spoke. I’ll do some more posts later but just to say well done</description>

      <description>We are down to the last few days so I encourage any attendees with blogs to blog the living daylights out of the event in the run-up. Thoughts, concerns, questions, ideas, musings. Bring it on. And don’t forget to tag with BarCampIreland.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet that there are a ton of GTD fans in our list of attendees. Anyone willing to give a talk introducing the idea and presenting some practical things that people can start doing immediately?</description>
