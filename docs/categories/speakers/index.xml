      <description>Bernie and his gang at IT Tipperary are looking to do interviews with some of the BarCamp speakers. I guess they will be released as podcasts. If you are up for it, send your telephone numbers, Skype details or SIP details to barcampireland at gmail dot com and they’ll make ya famous. Alternatively post them here as comments if you are really brave.
Also, keep adding or sending your PPTs, we only have a tiny collection so far.</description>

      <description>Tom Morris gave a talk at BarCamp which, like an idiot, I missed. Luckily he gave me the compact 2 minute version afterwards. He has a nice OPML file of various bits and pieces from the day. Check it out over at his blog.</description>

      <description>It is a little rough looking and the sound is awful, but what can you expect from a CameraPhone?

      <description>We’ve kicked off a page with the day’s presentations over on the wiki. You can either send the PPTs to us and we’ll upload them for you or you can do it yourself if you wish. Any problems, let us know. I’ll try and list all the talks in any case later today.</description>

      <description>If you gave a talk with slides on Saturday and you are OK with that PPT/ODT being re-distributed, please send them on to barcampireland at gmail dot com and we’ll collect them all together on one page for people to find. Thanks.</description>
