      <description>(sometimes it just what people goto events for!) The official afters for Barcamp Cork 2010 will be at Electric ( Website | Twitter | Facebook).
Electric is located at 41 South Mall (Google Maps), a mere hop, skip and a jump from the Barcamp Cork venue. Afters start at about 6:15/6:30 after Barcamp (we&amp;rsquo;ll be traveling in a pack from Barcamp), here the competition winners will be announced and award. Electric are very kindly providing us with complimentary finger food, however if you&amp;rsquo;ll be starving after the day (like myself) ring ahead (021-4222990) and make reservations, contact details will also be available at the event.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Sponsors of Barcamp Cork 2009, Microsoft, Assembly Point, Reilly &amp;amp; Co and Nitrosell, we have some freebies what we&amp;rsquo;d like to give away.
We&amp;rsquo;d like to run a fun competition which a few people can win, we&amp;rsquo;ll be giving away some great free techie stuff. We&amp;rsquo;d like if the competition promoted the sponsors too since they helped make Barcamp happen.
Any fun ideas for a competition?</description>

      <description>A few people attending BarCamp this week will be dusting off some no-so-modern pieces of hardware from their attics and bringing them along to show them off.
Check out Randy&amp;rsquo;s collection of toys on his blog, since he can&amp;rsquo;t carry them all on the day, let him know if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see any of them specifically.
Have you any computer hardware in the attic or garage that you could bring along?</description>

      <description>This years Barcamp Cork is taking place in the Cork International Airport hotel.

We have 3 large rooms booked for the day for concurrent talks with the option of splitting one of the rooms into two medium sized rooms.
There is a tiny little room too, off one of main rooms which might be good for smaller talks or demos. When the talks have wrapped up for the afternoon we can all wander across the hall to the bar for a couple of drinks and watch the match.</description>

      <description>This post should have been written last weekend so apologies for the slowness.
There are a bunch of people to thank for the success of BarCamp. It genuinely couldn&amp;rsquo;t have happened without them.
 YOU! BarCamp is about everyone contributing in some way. The speakers did an awesome job and everyone else asked, discussed, argued and queried brilliantly. Thank you all (110+ of you) for coming and making it the best BarCamp yet.</description>

      <description>Cork based TV and Video production company StormVids will be scooting and shooting throughout the day. Look out for their vids a few days later, all set to embed in your blogs and put on Facebook. I had a great chat with them last week and it&amp;rsquo;ll be fantastic to see some high-quality footage of BarCamp.
At the more grainy end of things, I&amp;rsquo;m sure the usual suspects (like me) will also be QIkking, Ustreaming and Flixwagoning on their phones.</description>

      <title>Webapp Update</title>

      <guid>https://barcampcork.com/2008/10/28/webapp-update/</guid>
      <description>After the feedback we&amp;rsquo;ve received on the &amp;ldquo;Build a Webapp in a Day&amp;rdquo; proposal along with some discussions last Friday, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to re-position things slightly.
The idea now is that the webapp will be the tangible output from a very extended training session in the Django web framework given by Bartosz Ptaszynski. The plan therefore is now as follows:
  Bart will kick off an introduction to Django as the first tutorial of the day at 10am Anyone who is interested and is generally competent in programming is very welcome to take part in the build At least one designer is needed to make this look great At 10.</description>

      <description>A few of us have been bouncing around the idea of building a web application in one day for the past few months. BarCamp seems like the ideal opportunity to try this. From the sign-up comments, it looks like plenty of people are interested in taking part. Unlike the impromptu style of the rest of the day, this one does require quite a bit of up-front preparation if it is to succeed.</description>

      <description>Bartosz Ptaszynski will be running a tutorial session on the Python Web Framework Django. It is aimed at anyone who wants to get a feel for what these frameworks are all about and how they can help you. One group in particular who might benefit are web designers who want some insight into the development process.
Django has effectively become the de facto Python Web framework over the past twelve months.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll have separate more detailed posts on a couple of the tutorial sessions in the next 2-3 days. The &amp;ldquo;build a web-app in a day&amp;rdquo; post is almost ready.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a page later today with all of the session topics suggested so far by people. However there is one aspect which we need to make clear. BarCamp is a non-commercial unconference and, as such, straight company or product pitches are not appropriate.
We don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound negative about this but it&amp;rsquo;s important. We all love our own companies and our own apps but speaking for 20 minutes about you isn&amp;rsquo;t really that interesting or educational.</description>

      <description>Rather than have everyone scatter to the four winds after BarCamp we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to have a sit-down meal followed by some drinks. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many good things about the Eastern Tandoori over the years so I&amp;rsquo;d like to suggest that. Please let us know in the comments if you&amp;rsquo;d like to attend. Once we know numbers we should be able to get a good-value fixed price menu.
As for drinks, suggestions?</description>

      <title>BarCamp Cork II Session Ideas</title>

      <description>In keeping with our approach of avoiding too much pre-structuring of the day, we are not going to ask people to formally announce session titles etc. However we do want to get some idea of the areas people want to [a] hear about and [b] talk about. If the day works well, those two things will merge. Rest assured that if you want to talk on something, you will get the opportunity.</description>
