      <description>Thanks to the Sponsors of Barcamp Cork 2009, Microsoft, Assembly Point, Reilly &amp;amp; Co and Nitrosell, we have some freebies what we&amp;rsquo;d like to give away.
We&amp;rsquo;d like to run a fun competition which a few people can win, we&amp;rsquo;ll be giving away some great free techie stuff. We&amp;rsquo;d like if the competition promoted the sponsors too since they helped make Barcamp happen.
Any fun ideas for a competition?</description>

      <title>Organising a *Camp</title>

      <description>If you attended BarCamp Cork and thought you&amp;rsquo;d like to run an unconference yourself, below is just a quick idea of what is involved.
  Try to have 2 and preferably 3 organisers. It&amp;rsquo;s possible as a solo run but can add to your stress level.
  The venue is the number 1 priority. If you can get it for free then you&amp;rsquo;ve done 75% of the work already.</description>

      <description>Every BarCamp is different and I hope we can learn each time from what went well and what didn&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m going to kick off with a few of my thoughts about last weekend but I&amp;rsquo;m much more interested in hearing all of your thoughts.
So in no particular order:
 The venue - still amazing and just ideal for an event like this Rooms - two is not enough. Even the addition of the small third room was insufficient.</description>
