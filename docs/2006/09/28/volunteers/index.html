      <p>We have a good bunch of people who have signed up as volunteers for the day. Many thanks to you all. Walter just did a mail-shot to you with a list of the things that need to be handled. The things we will need help with include:</p>
<p>Setup:
Chairs and tables and AV stuff.</p>
<p>Rooms:
One person per room to make sure everything is going smoothly and also to encourage discussion by asking questions if everyone is shy.</p>
<p>Catering:
Help with tea and coffee and biscuits and lunch and pizza.</p>
<p>Cleanup:
Ask Bosco says, tiddy up goodbye goodbye, put everything back in its box. Chairs and good remains.</p>
<p>Podcasting and interviewing and photographs:
Content creation on the day to share with those that could not get there.</p>
<p>Looks like we are in a good state and everything is coming together.</p>
<p>We should have news on Live Chat for the day shortly.</p>
<p>Remember to bring laptops, cameras, camera-phones and any other capture device you can think of to blog, vlog and podcast the day.</p>
