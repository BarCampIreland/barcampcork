      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re aiming for BarCamp-lite this time around. A minimum of fuss and bother around irrelevant contextual stuff and a maximum focus on making a kick-ass day that will be remembered. Having said that, we do need help with a bunch of things. If you can help with these in any way, please contact us at barcampcork AT gmail DOT com:
  Contributors - See the Manifesto post. A sign-up form will go up this week so you can register your interest in attending and giving some indication of how you would like to contribute on the day.</description>
