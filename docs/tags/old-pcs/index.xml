      <description>A few people attending BarCamp this week will be dusting off some no-so-modern pieces of hardware from their attics and bringing them along to show them off.
Check out Randy&amp;rsquo;s collection of toys on his blog, since he can&amp;rsquo;t carry them all on the day, let him know if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see any of them specifically.
Have you any computer hardware in the attic or garage that you could bring along?</description>
