      <description>A big thank you to Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom for sponsoring the lunch at BarCamp. The ice-swans and champagne fountains have been ordered. But seriously, Pat has been a fantastic supporter of of the tech community and many of us are in his debt.

Thanks also to John Henry Donovan of 5pieces who took care of the licensing of our sign-up form. This was totally unexpected and very much appreciated.</description>
