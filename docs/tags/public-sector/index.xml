      <description>I really hope I make it on the 1st but even if I don&amp;rsquo;t I wanted to make a point that the informal dialogue we are supposed to have as people interested in Web 2.0 is one we should extend to brands and organisations.
I don&amp;rsquo;t mean we should set up Bar Camp to sell services to them but I mean it&amp;rsquo;s be really valuable to engage with the corporate sector and the public sector so we can learn more about where they perceive their problems to be.</description>
