      <description>Bernie and his gang at IT Tipperary are looking to do interviews with some of the BarCamp speakers. I guess they will be released as podcasts. If you are up for it, send your telephone numbers, Skype details or SIP details to barcampireland at gmail dot com and they’ll make ya famous. Alternatively post them here as comments if you are really brave.
Also, keep adding or sending your PPTs, we only have a tiny collection so far.</description>

      <description>Tom Morris gave a talk at BarCamp which, like an idiot, I missed. Luckily he gave me the compact 2 minute version afterwards. He has a nice OPML file of various bits and pieces from the day. Check it out over at his blog.</description>

      <description>Sam Sethi over at TechCrunch UK has written about Saturday’s event. For those of you who don’t work in the web area, TechCrunch is the most highly trafficked and highly regarded web 2.0 news site. Sam recently launched the UK arm of it and has been very generous in his coverage of Ireland. Thanks for the mention Sam, I can’t wait to see where the next event will be held over here.</description>

      <description>I may be one of the organisers but can I just say:
BarCamp Ireland ROCKED!
It was the best event I’ve attended in a very long time and that was entirely due to the enthusiasm of all the attendees and in particular, those who spoke. I’ll do some more posts later but just to say well done</description>

      <description>The backnetwork is filling up nicely with people (don’t forget to make links to those you know) and we are just ready for the day.
If we don’t have your email address then we can’t send an invite.
But we will have a page up on the day with sign-up codes so you can grab one and sign-up via Wifi on the spot or do so after you get home.</description>

      <description>For those of you who are around on Friday evening, the un-plan is as follows:
I’ll be in Webworks all day at an EI course and we’ll be getting things like chairs, drinks and AV delivered throughout the day.
That course finishes at 5.30 4ish and we switch into BarCamp mode then. We will be doing setup for however long it takes so please pop on over to lend a hand if you are free.</description>

      <description>We have a good bunch of people who have signed up as volunteers for the day. Many thanks to you all. Walter just did a mail-shot to you with a list of the things that need to be handled. The things we will need help with include:
Setup: Chairs and tables and AV stuff.
Rooms: One person per room to make sure everything is going smoothly and also to encourage discussion by asking questions if everyone is shy.</description>

      <guid>https://barcampcork.org/2006/09/28/global-connections/</guid>
      <description>The guys organising BarCampMilwaukee want to do what they are calling a “Global Connections” session. They realised that their event, BarCampVienna, BarCampBerlin, BarCampIreland and others are all on over the same two day period and thought it might be interesting to hook up by various means at one point on Saturday.
Unfortunately they are running this at 7pm our time at which point we will all be gone. However, I thought it was worth mentioning in case any of our attendees wanted to hook up with these guys on their own to share experiences after our event.</description>

      <description>I took a few piccies of Webworks yesterday. It’s a lovely building with a great internal layout. Members of the backnetwork will see these automatically appear on the photos page.

      <description>I guess most people presenting will either
 Just talk Have Powerpoint Slides Have OpenOffice Impress slides Do live demos Give Wink screencasts Mime  Anyone intending to use Eric Meyer’s S5 as demonstrated to great effect by some of the microformats guys?
S5 is a Simple Standards based Slide Show System which uses XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If I manage to do a talk I’ll be basing a major part of it on existing S5-based presentations so I guess I’ll end up using it by default.</description>

      <description>We’re putting the call out again for projectors. At €125 a pop for the day, we’d prefer to not have to pay for these. At the moment we are assuming three parallel sessions but that may rise. Ideally we’d love to have 4 projectors or more. At the moment we have only one confirmed</description>

This is quite an important one as I’m sure every attendee will be parched from all their speaking. We will only provide drinks to those who sound hoarse Thanks Paula!</description>

      <description>Trinity Venture Capital have kindly given us sponsorship and will be speaking at the event too. We’re guessing a talk entitled “Understanding and accessing venture capital funding” is going to be ever so slightly popular.

      <description>Irish IT Conference turns the audience into the presenters.
