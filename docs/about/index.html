<p>BarCamp Cork was first held in 2006 in Webworks in Cork City. It was Ireland&rsquo;s first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> and first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">Unconference</a>. It was quickly followed by many others on the island, including Waterford, Dublin, Belfast and Galway. This first event was organised by Damien Mulley, Conor O&rsquo;Neill and Walter Higgins.</p>
<p>BarCamp Cork II followed in 2008, again in Webworks.</p>
<p>BarCamp Cork III was held in 2009 in the Cork International Airport Hotel</p>
<p>And the final edition, BarCamp Cork IV, returned to Webworks in November 2010.</p>
<p>BarCamp was about people getting together, sharing ideas, learning from each other and finding like-minds.</p>
<p>Conor decided to resurrect the old archive in September 2021 after doing the same to the old <a href="https://corkopencoffee.org/">Cork OpenCoffee</a> site. With everything that has happened in recent years, he has been wondering if we could all benefit from a return of both BarCamp and OpenCoffee or their spiritual successors.</p>
<p>This archive covers all of the posts from BarCamp II, III and IV.</p>
<p>The first event was organised on the main <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/400866/BarCampIreland">global BarCamp site here</a> and on a blog that was accidentally deleted. Luckily most of that blog content was scraped by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913211050/http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog/">Wayback Machine</a> and is available here now too.</p>
<p>A great set of photos from the first BarCamp are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barcampireland/">still on Flickr</a></p>
<p>There is also a set of posts Conor made about the event on the Argolon Blog:</p>

<p>This quote from Paul O&rsquo;Mahony still resonates.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;BarCamp Cork is a great day.  It&rsquo;s packed with people who are developing new tools for improving the world.
Think of the usual Conference - with its usual Process fixed in advance.  Think of how regimented and un-surprising conferences often are&hellip;
BarCamp Cork is different - it is an &ldquo;Un-Conference&rdquo; - alive with an air of chaos.  There are so many things going on at the same time - you have a hard job deciding which event you can afford to miss.
Loads of choice - short snappy sessions - lots of switched on people hanging round -  keen to network.
BarCamp Cork is fun while you dunk yourself in the cooking pot.  This is where you catch up on the future - get a good view on what&rsquo;s coming over the horizon - and new ways of using stuff you thought you knew.
Treat yourself to a day that&rsquo;ll sharpen you up on the latest trends&hellip;&quot;</em></p>
